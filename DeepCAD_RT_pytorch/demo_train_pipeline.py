"""
This file will demonstrate pipeline for training microscopy data using the DeepCAD-RT algorithm.
The demo shows how to construct the params and call the relevant functions for training DeepCAD-RT network.
The demo will automatically download tif file for demo training.
See inside for details.

* This demo is also available as a jupyter notebook (see demo_train_pipeline.ipynb) and Colab notebook (see
DeepCAD_RT_demo_colab.ipynb)

More information can be found in the companion paper.
